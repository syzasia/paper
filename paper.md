# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which
measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported
away from the source region.

# Methodology
We compared our measurements of particle aging with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.

# Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth
mechanism for these particles.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process. 
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.
